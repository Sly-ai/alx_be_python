Project Overview

This collection of Python scripts and programs serves as an introductory dive into the Python programming language. Each file addresses a specific programming challenge or concept, ranging from basic syntax to more complex problem-solving. The aim is to demonstrate understanding of core Python features and best practices.
Learning Objectives

Through these exercises, I aimed to gain proficiency in:

    Basic Python Syntax: Understanding variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets), and operators.

    Functions: Defining and calling functions, understanding parameters and return values.

    Input/Output: Interacting with the user and displaying results.

    Problem Solving: Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts and implementing logical solutions.


Tasks and Concepts Covered

This repository includes solutions for various tasks, which may cover:

    Arithmetic Operations: Programs performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

    Calculators: Simple calculators for finance, age, or geometric shapes (e.g., rectangle area).

    Unit Converters: Scripts to convert between different units (e.g., hours to seconds).

    Data Structures: Basic manipulation of lists, dictionaries, and strings.

    Modular Programming: Organizing code into functions for reusability.

Each Python file (.py) typically corresponds to a specific task or exercise.
Getting Started

To run these Python scripts on your local machine, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Sly-ai/alx_be_python.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    cd alx_be_python

    Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from python.org.

Usage

To run a specific Python script, use the python command followed by the script's filename:

python filename.py

For example:

python 0-add.py

Follow any on-screen prompts for input.
